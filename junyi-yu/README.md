# Technical Exercise 5: Webzines!
## Overview
For this exercise, we will be creating quick one-page webzines using our knowledge of HTML and CSS. If you don't know what a zine is, research them here:

- <https://guides.lib.purdue.edu/loudonpaper/what-is-a-zine>
- <https://pawcatguide.com/blog/what-is-a-zine>

Your zine can be about whatever you want! Some starting points might be:

- A fanzine about your pet or favorite band, show, or etc.
- A spooky or creepy comic for fall
- A photo zine of pictures you have taken
- Literally anything else you can think of!

## Process

### Submit Your GitHub Info
Use this form to give me your GitHub username and email address:

- <https://forms.gle/q3pY8BrfAuopBT9g7>

I will use this info to give you collaborator access to this repository.

### Create Your Page
For this project you will be creating a new folder in this repository and placing an index.html and style.css file into it. The folder name should be the title of your zine in all lowercase with "-"s instead of spaces. The content of your zine should be housed in the index.html and should be styled with your style.css. Your page should content:

- 4+ images or other media elements
- h1 and p tags and 100+ words
- custom layout, colors, and fonts (at least 10 style rules)

Note: you should also have an "assets" folder within your zine folder to house all of your images.

### Add Your Folder To The Repository
Once you have created your page, you should [clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and add your folder to the root of the repository. To do this you will:

1. Clone the repository with GitHub Desktop
2. Open the file explorer on your computer
3. Drag and drop (or copy and paste) your folder into the repository folder.
4. Open the repository in Atom and text that your page works. It should be live at something like 127.0.0.1/(name of your folder)/
5. After its tested and working, push your update to the origin.

Your submission for the assignment will be your completed folder uploaded to the repository, no submission on Canvas. Due Sunday 10/2 @ midnight.

### Follow-up
After everyone has uploaded their folders, I will create a home page for all the zines.
