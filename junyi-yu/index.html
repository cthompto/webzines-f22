  <p> In ancient mythology there is a magic cube that everyone is looking for.
     It can change it at will, because every time the holder changes the block
     and restores it to the original state, the wish will be fulfilled.</p>

  <p>But many people died before they got him, because he was a relic of a
    certain royal authority, and when the royal authority passed away, he was
    used as a funeral object, and the tomb had heavy organs and unexpected
    rooms. The only thing known is that the closer you get to the coffin of
    the kingship, the slower it gets. Even the surrounding water droplets
    were frozen in mid-air.</p>

  <p>After people's word, there was a lucky person who came across it. It's a
    pity that Phantom Cube did not fulfill his wish like the legend, because
    the cube felt that the person was not qualified. Instead, he devoured his
    soul and kicked him out of the tomb. The man went insane permanently
    until he died, and no one got any news from him.</p>
