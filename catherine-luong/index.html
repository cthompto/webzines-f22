  <h1>Masquerade</h1>
  <p><i>Hey, guys! This is an old dead project I had, which I might as well show off,
      since it's not going anywhere. It was a big passion project that ended simply
      because I realized that I didn't listen to any feedback and I paid for it.
      Basically a bad case of trying to strive for perfection and not cutting your
      losses when you needed to. It had a whole year's worth of work put into it,
      so it was too late to fix it and I never really got the motivation to go
      back to it again.</i>

    Humans do not go into the Otherworld, land of the spirits, on a whim. They
    either come on their own accord, or they were taken by force.
    <br>
    <br>
    Elise, or the <b>Wanderer</b>, has no idea how she got here, except she has
    one goal and that is to defeat the <b>Devouring One</b>. The spirit has been
    pulling humans into the Otherworld and feasting on them and somehow this is
    Eliseâ€™s job to stop that. Confused and annoyed, she reluctantly accepts her
    task and sets off to gather as much power as she can.
    But questions plague her mind. Why is it her, of all people, who had to find a
    way to help all of these people? Who was she? And most importantly, will she be
    the same person as she was, before she had lost her memories?
    <br>
    <br>
    In a battle between being noble or pragmatic, Elise must find all the pieces of
    her mask to recover her memories and her powers to find out the truth behind
    this masquerade. Will Elise save everyone or lose herself to the Otherworld?
