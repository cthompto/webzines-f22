    <p>This is bObA. He loves getting high on catnip :) <br>
      We adopted bObA in October, 2018. Because it was halloween season, black cats were giving out for free.
      When we share this story to his Vet. They told us that it is strange for them to giving out black cats for free during halloween season
    because some people adopt black cats in Halloween to sacrifice them. Some people still practice that ritual nowadays, so some centers
  don't even allow adopting black cats during Halloween time. </p>

    <p>This is Helen. She is my dad's dog <br>
      Helen loves sleeping and often wakes up really late in the morning. Other dogs would love to go for 
      a walk in the morning, but Helen rather gets some more sleep. Helen doesn't get along well with bObA and her best friend is Lucy even though she gets bullied sometimes.
      but, who is Lucy?

     <p>So, this is Lucy, Helen's best friend, and her favorite ball!<br>
      Lucy is almost 12 years old. She loves hanging our at dog parks and playing catching the balls. Even though she is old now, she is still
      full of energy for playing. She can still run around catching the ball, but will get tired quickly.
      Because Lucy is old, she is losing her sight and nose's pigment and can't smell the food, so she doesn't enjoy eating recently &#128531;
