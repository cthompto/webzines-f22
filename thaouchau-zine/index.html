    <p>This is bObA. He loves getting high on catnip :) <br>
      We adopted bObA in October, 2018. Because it was Halloween season, black cats were given out for free.
      When we shared this story to his Vet, they told us that it was strange for them to be giving out black cats for free during Halloween season
    because some people adopt black cats during Halloween to sacrifice them. Some people still practice this ritual nowadays, so some centers
  won't even allow adopting black cats during Halloween time. </p>

    <p>This is Helen. She is my dad's dog. <br>
      We adopted Helen when she was already 3 years old. Helen loves sleeping and often wakes up really late in the morning. Other dogs would love to go for 
      a walk in the morning, but Helen would rather sleep some more. Helen doesn't get along well with bObA and her best friend is Lucy even though she gets bullied sometimes.
      but, who is Lucy?

     <img src="./assets/lucy.png" width="590px" alt="Photo of Lucy holding a ball in her mouth">
     <p>So, this is Lucy, Helen's best friend, and this is Lucy's favorite ball!<br>
      Lucy was adopted when she was a puppy and is now almost 12 years old. She loves hanging our at dog parks and playing catch. Even though she is old now, she is still
      full of energy. She can still run around catching the ball, but will get tired quickly.
      Because Lucy is old, she is losing her sight and nose pigment and can't smell food, so she hasn't enjoy eating recently. &#128531;

     <img src="./assets/miutea.png" width="550px" alt="Photo of Miutea laying in the box">
     <p>And, this is Miutea and his favorite spot!<br>
      Miutea is bObA's big borther. They were adopted at the same time, but he is much more outgoing and dominant. Miutea is super arogant and doesn't like any of the other pets. Except bObA, sometimes.
      He loves boxes and would always go into any to take a nap. The smaller the boxes, the better!!!
