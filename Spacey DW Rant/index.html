<h1> A Rant about Doctor Who- Specifically the Faults with the Chibnall Run Era </h1>

<p> There is nothing short of actual artistry in the last 3 seasons of our beloved sci-fi series.
  From the effects, cinematography, and costume design- there are are a lot of fantastic visual elements.
What lacks however is good design in some of this art. <br> <br>
For example: the main console design, the main setpiece for the series
is calustrophonic, poorly lit, and lacks memorial pieces. The promotional material while discussing it, seemed to be not fully thruthful as its rarely shown onscreen.</p>
 <br> <br> <br>

<h2> Romance in Space? </h2>
<div class= "p_img">
<img src= "assets/thasmine.jpeg"></img> </div>
<p>While nuwho us not new to romances, this one is historic. But is it earned? One of the ufortunate issues of the current run is
the characters that were created.Graham was by far the most interesting. Mostly Graham who, unique because of his age to the show,
presented themes and an arc about loss and grief in a very new and intriguing way. <br> <br> Ryan as an auxilary character to Graham,
bringsstory moments to the table, but was far less interesting. And lastly, poor Yaz who was unrelated to either Ryan
orr graham with any real footing, had much more charismatic character, but nothing of note. <br><br>
 It only made sense that with a female lead, and another female companion, that there would be online shipping in Fandom.
Sadly Yaz has so little of good character to her, that her relationship to the doctor wasnt grounded at all for its introduction
in season 13. Thus making it hard fo anyone to take seriously. Overall it is beacause we've barrely had time to know the characters
does thasmine feel like it was shoehorned in for diversity. </p>
<br> <br> <br>

<h2> Plot holes and Revelations </h2>
<div class= "p_img">
<img src= "assets/flux.jpeg"> </img></div>
<p> The biggest issue was the main plots. No one can truly say Chibnall didnt try to bring that hollywood pizzaz to the series.
With the camera quality, score, effects imprrovements, and style- It certainly felt like there was an effort to be made to Hollywoodify the series.
<br> <br> is that what Doctor Who needed however? Did we need more unnnecesary backstory, large revelations. Porbably not, but was Chibnall doing anything that wasn't say as groundbreaking as creating the
Time War, and basing the whole character around it. Or recasting the actor into a completely looking man, writing lore around it just so the series kep going?
Probably also yes. </p>

<br>
<p>What have we learned? that while these last few years werer sucky, souless, and stupid.
  Our complaints are mo differnt than the past's, and we shouldnt hate so much our favorrite series.
  No matter how dumb the new lore is. Or something like that. </p>
