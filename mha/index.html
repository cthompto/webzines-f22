      <p style="background-color:white;">My hero academia is a story about a hero-based society where humans evolved to have powers called quirks. With these quirks, the hero society rose where 80% of people have quirks and the 20% do not. Our Main Character, Izuku Midoriya, sadly doesn't have a quirk. He's been dreaming of becoming a hero, and yet he never developed a quirk unlike his rival, Katsuki Bakugou. This distraughts our main character, but in turns of events, he gets to meet the number one hero by being rescued by him! He took his shot, asking his idol if he can become a hero, even without a quirk, and our Number one hero, all might, shuts him down. Midoriya has to come to terms with this, though he sees a villain has taken his rival as hostage! His body moved on his own and attempted to rescue his friend. All Might witnesses this and changes his mind, he comes to rescue everyone and succeeds. Midoriya is scolded of course for doing something so careless and goes on to go home. All Might finds Midoriya and tells him his major secret. That he himself didn't have a quirk, his power was passed on to him and now he choses young Midoriya to take the torch and to inherit his power. A strong first episode/book and this is what caught my eye. Giving hope to someone whose dream was impossible, yet here he is, having one of the best opportunities in life. Of course he doesn’t immediately receive the power, he has to work for it, physically, if not the quirk will reject him and might end up killing him. In a short span of time, he builds his own body into a vessel that can “somewhat” withhold the new power. He also is trying to get into the most prestigious school that has one of the top hero courses (All Might attended there so Midoriya wants to go there as well).  The series continues to watch him grow in power and learn how he can handle his own power. Once he has a handle on it, we finally get into the core of the story, the villains and the revival of the ultimate villain. Just as All Might has the ability to transfer his quirk to someone else until it is no longer in his possession (called One for all), there is the opposite quirk of someone being able to take quirks and keep them in possession and or transfer it to another person without consent or the faults that come along with said quirks. The ultimate’s villain name is All for one, and he has his own vessel to transfer his quirk and be reborn into a new vessel.

This show is amazing, the build up from season one to season 4 is amazing, the stakes are high, the drama and consequences. The show is great, but I think it has reached a point where everything feels mid/not as intense or as interesting. Seasons 5 was a complete flop to me. It doesn’t follow the villain arc correctly (relating to the manga), in fact it was shortened and mostly concentrated on the student’s life which was one of the most boring moments in the series. I was disappointed, season 4 was one of the most heart wrenching, tear jerking, trauma inducing seasons that has ever existed compared to the other seasons within this show. Knowing what is coming up from the manga, season 6 might be picking back up on the intensity of the story. I look forward to seeing people’s reaction of people who only watch the anime, and knowing well enough, there is going to be a lot of people crying over their favorite characters suffering in this new season.
