<h3> What I like to do in my freetime <h3>
 In my free time, I like to relax and do things that calm me down or doesn't require thinking. I will be talking about what that includes as I think that relaxing is such a big thing
    and should not be neglected, but too much is also not good.

<h1> Watch streamers </h1>

<h2> Streamers are something that I discovered a couple years ago and since then, watching them play games, react to videos and just live their lives has been something I loved as it doesn't require me to buy the games
they play nor do I need to spend money to experience things through them. Its like a free pass to games to get a feel of it before getting it myself and watching others watch what I would watch and enjoying their reaction to
something that I am also watching and feeling company when my friends are asleep. </h2>

<h1> Play games </h1>

<h2> This has been something that I have loved since I was a kid, from playing super mario 64 to animal crossing to risk of rain to hades,
   I enjoyed every aspect of it, including the sounds in the games and the unique gameplay that comes with it. Games will never be something I stop playing and I hope it stays that way</h2>

<h1> Sleep </h1>

<h2> Sleep is just such a no brainer. My bed absorbs me when I am tired and when its time and I cannot come to hate it. Sometimes I wish I didn't need to wake up so I can enjoy sleep a little longer.</h2>

<h1> Read manga </h1>

    <h2> Reading manga has always been a bedtime ritual for me as it gets my mind off everything while also making me feel like I am in another world. </h2>
    <p> My favorite genres are romance, comedy, action, fantasy and adventure</p>
