<p>Do-ho Suh collaborates Korean characteristics with his works. The environment in which he grew up can tell why he brought Korean characteristics in his art values. Do-ho Suh's sculpture is architectural, characterized by its beauty and delicacy. </p>

<p>
  Seoul Home is a monumental fabric sculptural installation work in 1999, inspired by Do-ho Suh’s Korean traditional family house in Korea, and it embodies a strong relationship between Korean identity and his works. “Suh symbolically lessens his longing for this cherished space by creating an easily transportable replica, one light enough to fold and carry with him.”2 Do-ho Suh's work begins with a keen awareness of the surrounding environment and relationships with people. Home, space, and cultural conflicts are the main materials used in his works. Suh constantly looks around to portray his surroundings in the works. He made it possible to rediscover his identity as a Korean and ask questions about his identity between private and public spaces. The most important and interesting fact of Seoul Home is created based on the precise measurement of the traditional Korean traditional house that Suh grew up in Korea, called Hanok.

<p>Do-ho Suh’s representative work series of "home" is made out of cloth with a translucent installation. The light and the flexible fabric was a suitable medium that could be folded and unfolded his gates, walls, homes, and apartments. </p>
